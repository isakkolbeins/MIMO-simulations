Setup for simulation

Single "base station" - with M=6 antennas
Supplying 3 users 

Graph 1 - Shows different beam forming 
    a. Single beam forming from the 6 antennas
    b. 3x Beam forming - using 2 antennas for each beam


1. Scenario 
    Explore different degrees of separation (angular difference between the users )
    [ 90, 60, 30, 15, 10, 5 ]

    For each different degree of separation - calculate the received signal power.
        
        Plot a bar chart - where the received power is displayed in terms of each user 1-3
        For each angle of separation

2. Scenario
    Repeat 2-3 of the cases above for an angle offset from the actual horizontal - having to focus the beams at an angle from the antennas

    For each degree of separation - and angle of offset
    Graph 3d? 


3. Show how for each of the Scenarios above increasing the number of antennas wil enhace the performace
